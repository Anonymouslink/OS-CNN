This is code for the paper here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10061


###
For useï¼š 
my environment is:
python == 3.5
pytorch == 1.1.0
scikit-learn == 0.21.3.

### Easy use ###
1_1_OS-CNN_easy_use_Run_and_Save_Model.ipynb
    This is a easy use OS-CNN
    search "X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = TSC_data_loader(dataset_path, dataset_name)"
    you could replace the "X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test" as you like, or you could change dataset_name to determine which UCR dataset you want to run
###

### OS Vs Inception ###
For people who think the OS-CNN is a type of Inception, please have a look at this 
###

### I cannot see anything ###
Github some times cannot render ipynb file if you find some pages cannot load plz wait for a while, and try again!!!!

    This is a easy use OS-CNN
    search "X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = TSC_data_loader(dataset_path, dataset_name)"

1_2_OS-CNN_load_saved_model_for_prediction.ipynb
    This code could help you to load morel and use the model for prediction (it should be used after 1_1 both them can train and save model)
    
1_3_OS-CNN_network_structure.ipynb
    This shows the network structure of OS-CNN

1_4_compare_result.ipynb
    In here, you could select different models to compare with os-cnn
